# Epikins

This project is still under development.  

It aims to help Epitech pedagogical team and students to handle automated testing in a better way.  
It's using Jenkins json api to fetch jobs and start them.

## Currently supported features:
* Microsoft office authentication instead of using jenkins one
* Start automated tests (ATs) as a member of the pedagogical team
* Limit the number of ATs per week to 3 for each project (reseted each monday at midnight)

## Coming soon:
* Start ATs as a student (for their group only, not for others groups)
* Add a full role management (pedagogical team assistant, pedagogical team member, module manager, admin)
* Change ATs limit dynamically for a given project as a module manager
* View a log to know precisely who started a build, to who and when
