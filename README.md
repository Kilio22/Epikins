It's using Jenkins json api to fetch jobs and start them.

## Currently supported features:
* Microsoft office authentication
* Start automated tests (ATs) as a member of the pedagogical team
* Start ATs as a student
* Full role management
* Change ATs limit dynamically for a given project as a module manager

## Coming soon:
